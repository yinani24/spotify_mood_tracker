## Spotify Mood Tracker

### Background
Through this application, a person can sign on and see a dashboard of the playlists they listen to and how it translates to the type of mood associated with it. This is used to create a recommendation playlist for them for the day.
(Idea is bound to change during construction with more addition or removal of features depending on the capability and availability of my time)
